üß≠ Compass - Better Code Navigation

Lost? Tired of endlessly scrolling through tabs just to find the previous file you were working on?

Compass provides you the list of most-recently used tabs. It also helps you filter them by special tags!

By default, `ctrl+tab` jumps you to the next view in the MRU stack without showing the stack.
Compass provides you a visual guide of where you have been.

### How To Use

You must first enable the keybindings. From the command palette, select `Compass: Keybindings`
The plugin already has pre-commented keybinds that you can just copy
